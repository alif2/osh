# osh

osh (other shell) is a basic Unix shell created as a project for an Operating Systems class.

osh can read the input in the Unix command line to launch a process, redirect the contents of a file to a process, redirect the results of a process to a file, and pipe the results of one process into another.

The files parse.cpp and parse.h were provided by the professor for this project
